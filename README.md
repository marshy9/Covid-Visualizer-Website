This product is a COVID-19 data visualizer that allows the user to view COVID-19 data in a meaningful way; this application allows the user to view COVID-19 cases, as well as COVID-19 deaths, on a map of the United States.

The map is divided into cells that correspond to each of the counties that exist in a particular state.

The user can zoom in and out on the map, as well as hover over a particular county in order to view the corresponding information (deaths, cases).
